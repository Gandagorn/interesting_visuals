# Graphs and Visualizations

I post some data visualizations with code on topics that I find interesting.
My goal is to learn more about data visualization and how to extract meaningful information from vast amounts of public data.

Most visualizations are also on reddit:
Simpsons Interaction Intensity: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/kkp3lr/oc_interaction_intensity_in_the_simpsons/
South Park Interaction Intensity: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/kz8se5/oc_interaction_intensity_in_south_park/
Lord of The Rings Interaction Intensity: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/m9cver/oc_interaction_intensity_in_lord_of_the_rings/
