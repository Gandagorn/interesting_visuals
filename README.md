# Graphs and Visualizations

I post some data visualizations with code on topics that I find interesting.
My goal is to learn more about data visualization and how to extract meaningful information from vast amounts of public data.
I tried to include most of the datasets, however often they are too big for Github. If you need the data, write me a message!

Some visualizations are also posted on reddit:

- [South Park Interaction Intensity](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/kz8se5/oc_interaction_intensity_in_south_park/)
