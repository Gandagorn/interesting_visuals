A rather unfair observation  As we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales  and the smoking of pipeweed.  But where our hearts truly lie  is in peace and quiet  and good tilled earth.  For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.

774,LEGOLAS, I have not the heart to tell you. For me the grief is still too near.,Scene 38 ~ Caras Galadhon,The Fellowship of the Ring
775,SAM," I bet they don’t mention his fireworks. There should be a verse about them. “The finest rockets ever seen. They burst in stars of blue and green.

776,ARAGORN, Take some rest. These borders are well-protected.,Scene 38 ~ Caras Galadhon,The Fellowship of the Ring
777,BOROMIR," I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me “Even now there is hope left.” But I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope. My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing. And now our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right and I would do it. I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it Aragorn? The White tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? ",Scene 38 ~ Caras Galadhon,The Fellowship of the Ring

784,GALADRIEL, I know what it is you saw. For it is also in my mind.  It is what will come to pass if you should fail. The Fellowship is breaking. It has already begun. He will try to take the Ring.

800,PIPPIN, Four.,Scene 41 ~ Farewell to Lorien,The Fellowship of the Ring
801,CELEBORN," Every league you travel south, the danger will increase. Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin. Nor will you find safety on the western bank. Strange creatures bearing the white hand have been seen on our borders. Seldom do Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so.  Le aphadar aen. *You are being tracked* By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.",Scene 41 ~ Farewell to Lorien,The Fellowship of the Ring
802,GALADRIEL," My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim. Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.  These are the daggers of the Noldorin. They have already seen service in war.

805,GIMLI," Nothing. Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time, for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.  Actually, there was one thing.  No, no, I couldn’t. It’s quite impossible. Stupid to ask…",Scene 41 ~ Farewell to Lorien,The Fellowship of the Ring

808,GALADRIEL," That choice is yet before her. You have your own choice to make, Aragorn. To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil, or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin. Namárië. *Farewell.* Nadath nâ i moe cerich.

There are other ways, Frodo. Other paths that we might take.",Scene 43 ~ Parth Galen,The Fellowship of the Ring
837,FRODO, I know what you would say. It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.,Scene 43 ~ Parth Galen,The Fellowship of the Ring
