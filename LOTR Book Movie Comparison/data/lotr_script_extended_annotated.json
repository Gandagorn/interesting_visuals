Han mathon ne nen  Han mathon ne chae  A han noston ned gwilith  Much that once was is lost. For none now live who remember it.","1":"It began with the forging of the Great Rings.","2":"Three were given to the elves.  Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.  Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.  And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men.  Who above all else, desire power. ","3":"For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.  But they were all of them deceived.  For another ring was made.  In the land of Mordor,  in the fires of Mount Doom  the dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master Ring  to control all others and into this Ring he poured all his cruelty, his malice  and his will to dominate all life.  One Ring to rule them all.","4":"One by one the free lands of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted.  A last alliance of Elves and Men marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth.","5":"Tangado haid! ","6":"Leithio i philinn! ","7":"Victory was near.  But the power of the Ring  could not be undone.","8":"It was in this moment,  that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father\u0092s sword.","9":"Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth was defeated.  The Ring passed to Isildur.  Who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.  But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted.  And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.","10":"It betrayed Isildur  to his death.  And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.  History became legend, legend became myth,  and for two and a half thousand years the Ring passed out of all knowledge.  Until, when chance came  It ensnared a new bearer. ","11":"My Precious!","12":"The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.  And there it consumed him.","13":"It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my Precious.","14":"The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum\u0092s cave it waited.  Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumour grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear.  And the Ring of Power perceived.  Its time had now come.  It abandoned Gollum.  But something happened then that the Ring did not intend, it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. ","15":"What\u0092s this?","16":"A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. ","17":"A Ring! .","18":" Lost!  My Precious is lost.","19":"For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.","20":"The 22nd day of September in the year 1400  by Shire reckoning.  Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West Farthing, The Shire, Middle Earth.  The Third Age of this world.","21":"There and back again, A Hobbit\u0092s tale, by Bilbo Baggins.  Now, where to begin? Ah, yes.  Concerning Hobbits. ","22":"Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years.  quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk.  Middle Earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted amongst the very wise. ","23":" Frodo, someone at the door.  In fact, it has been remarked by some that Hobbits\u0092 only real passion is for food.  A rather unfair observation  As we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales  and the smoking of pipeweed.  But where our hearts truly lie  is in peace and quiet  and good tilled earth.  For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.  And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint  But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life. ","24":"Frodo, the door!  sticklebacks, where is that boy! FRODO! ","25":"Hmm hmm hmm hmm, Down from the door where it began, hmm hmm hmm hmm","26":"And I must follow if I can.  The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began, now far ahead the road has gone, and I must follow if I can.","27":"You\u0092re late!","28":"A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins.  Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to.","29":"Its wonderful to see you Gandalf. ","30":"You didn\u0092t think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo\u0092s birthday? ","31":"So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a party of special significance?","32":"You know Bilbo he\u0092s got the whole place in an uproar.","33":"Well that should please him. ","34":"Half the Shire\u0092s been invited.  And the rest of them are turning up anyway. ","35":"And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has this past age.  Full of its own comings and goings with change coming slowly, if it comes at all.  For things are made to endure in the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There\u0092s always been a Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End ","36":"And there always will be.","37":"To tell you the truth, Bilbo has been acting a bit odd lately.  I mean, more than usual. He\u0092s taken to locking himself in his study.  He spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I\u0092m not looking.","38":"Where\u0092s it gone?","39":"Aaaaah. ","40":"He\u0092s up to something.  All right then, keep your secrets!","41":"What? ","42":"But I know you have something to do with it.","43":"Good gracious me!","44":"Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.","45":"Indeed?","46":"We never had any adventures, or did anything unexpected.","47":"If you\u0092re referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.","48":"Whatever you did, you\u0092ve been officially labelled as a \u0091disturber of the peace.\u0092","49":"Oh really?","50":"Gandalf! Gandalf!","51":"Fireworks Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks Gandalf!","52":"Hooooraaaay! ","53":"Gandalf, I\u0092m glad you\u0092re back.","54":"So am I dear boy.  So am I.","55":" No thank you! We don\u0092t want any more visitors, well wishers or distant relations! ","56":"And what about very old friends?","57":"Gandalf?","58":"Bilbo Baggins. ","59":"My dear Gandalf! ","60":"It\u0092s good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old who would believe it.  You haven\u0092t aged a day! ","61":"Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are.","62":"Tea or maybe something a little stronger? I\u0092ve got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296, a very good year, almost as old as I am.","63":"It was laid down by my father, what say we open one eh?","64":"Just tea, thank you.","65":"Owwwh! ","66":"I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it matters; you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will.","67":"You\u0092ve caught me a bit unprepared I\u0092m afraid urm we\u0092ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and there\u0092s some cheese here, oh no that wont do! Urm we\u0092ve got raspberry jam, an apple tart  but we\u0092ve not much for afters. Oh no we\u0092re all right, I\u0092ve found some sponge cake!  I can make you some eggs if you oh . Gandalf? ","68":"Just tea, thank you.","69":"Oh right.  You don\u0092t mind if I do, do you? ","70":"Oh not at all!","71":"Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins! ","72":" I\u0092m not at home!  It\u0092s the Sackville-Bagginses.","73":"I know you\u0092re in there!","74":"They\u0092re after the house!  They\u0092ve never forgiven me for living this long. I\u0092ve got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment\u0092s peace.  I want to see mountains again, mountains Gandalf.  And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea! ","75":"So you mean to go through with your plan then?","76":"Yes, yes, it\u0092s all in hand. All the arrangements are made.  Oh, thank you.","77":"Frodo suspects something.","78":"Of course he does, he\u0092s a Baggins, not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle. ","79":"You will tell him wont you?","80":"Yes, yes.","81":"He\u0092s very fond of you.","82":"I know, he\u0092d probably come with me if I asked him to. I think in his heart Frodo\u0092s still in love with the Shire, the woods, the fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don\u0092t look it, but I\u0092m beginning to feel it in my heart.  I feel thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday. And I don\u0092t expect that I shall return. In fact, I mean not to.","83":"Old Toby, the finest weed in the Southfarthing.","84":"Gandalf my old friend, this will be a night to remember.","85":"Hello, Hello, Fatty Bolger  Lovely to see you, Welcome, Welcome","86":" Go on Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.","87":" Ah, I think I'll just have another ale. ","88":"Oh no you dont  Go on ","89":" So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls and they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook us. Whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly.  They spent so much time arguing the witherto's and whyfor's that the sun's first light cracked open over the top of the trees. Poof!  and turned them all into stone!","90":"Quickly ","91":"No no! the big one, big one!","92":"Mrs Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome welcome. Are all these children yours ?","93":"Yeah","94":"Good gracious you have been productive!","95":" Sackville-Bagginses!  Quickly! Hide!","96":"Oh! Thankyou my boy You're a good lad Frodo. I'm very selfish you know.  Yes, I am. Very selfish. I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died, but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because, of all my numerous relations, you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.","97":"Bilbo have you been at the Gaffers homebrew ?","98":"No. Well yes, b b b but thats not the point. The point is, Frodo,  You'll be alright. ","99":"Done!","100":"You're supposed to stick it in the ground ","101":"It is in the ground ","102":"Outside ","103":"It was your idea!","104":"Bilbo! Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon ","105":" Dragon! Nonsense, there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years. ","106":"That was good!","107":"Lets get another one!","108":"Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took! I might have known!","109":"Speech Bilbo ","110":"Speech!","111":"My dear Bagginses and Boffins,  Tooks and Brandybucks , Grubbs , Chubbs , Hornblowers , Bulgers , Bracegirdles , and Proudfoots","112":" PROUDFEET! ","113":"Today is my One Hundred and Eleventh birthday! ","114":"Happy Birthday!","115":"Alas, elevnty-one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits.  I don't know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you, half as well as you deserve.  I, er,  I have things to do   I've put this off for far too long.  I regret to announce This is the End. I'm going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell.  Goodbye ","116":" I suppose you think  that was terribly clever.","117":"Come on Gandalf. Did you see their faces! ","118":"There are many magic rings in this world Bilbo Baggins and none of them should be used lightly","119":" It was just a bit of fun! Oh, you're probably right as usual!  You will keep an eye on Frodo won't you ?","120":"Two eyes.","121":"Thanks","122":"As often as I can spare.","123":"I'm leaving everything to him.","124":"What about this ring of yours ? Is that staying too ?","125":"Yes, yes. Its in an envelope over there on the mantlepiece. ","126":"No! Wait.... it's... here in my pocket. Ha!  Isn't that Isn't that odd now. Yet after all why not, Why shouldn't I keep it.","127":"I think you should leave the ring behind Bilbo. Is that so hard ?","128":" Well no ...... and ... yes..   Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it. It's mine, I found it! It came to ME!","129":"There's no need to get angry","130":"Well if I'm angry it's your fault! It's mine  My only.... My Precious","131":"Precious ? It's been called that before. Not by you!","132":"OH! What business is it of yours what I do with my own things!","133":"I think you've had that ring quite long enough.","134":" You want it for yourself!","135":" BILBO BAGGINS!  Do not take me for some conjuror of cheap tricks!  I am not trying to rob you!  I'm trying to help you.","136":" All your long years we've been friends. Trust me as you once did. Let it go","137":"You're right Gandalf. The ring must go to Frodo  It's late, the road is long  Yes, it is time. ","138":"Bilbo! The ring is still in your pocket.","139":" oh! yes..  ","140":"and I'm sure you will my dear friend.","141":"Goodbye Gandalf. ","142":"Goodbye. Dear Bilbo","143":"\"the road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began..\"","144":"Until our next meeting.","145":"It's mine. My own, My precious","146":"Riddles in the dark","147":" Bilbo!  Bilbo! ","148":" My Precious.","149":" He's gone hasn't he  He talked for so long about leaving.  I didn't think he'd really do it. Gandalf ? ","150":" Hmm.  Bilbo's Ring.","151":"Where are you going ?","152":"I have some things I have to attend to.","153":"What things ?","154":"Questions  Questions that need answering.","155":"You've only just arrived!  I don't understand.","156":" Neither do I.  Keep it Secret. Keep it Safe. ","157":"Murder! Shire! Baggins!","158":"The year 3434 of the Second Age. Here follows the account of Isildur, the High King of Gondor, and the finding of the Ring of Power.  It has come to me, the One Ring, and it shall be an heirloom of my Kingdom  All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate  for I shall risk no hurt to the Ring. It is precious to me. Though I buy it with a great pain  The markings upon the band begin to fade  The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared  A secret now that only fire can tell. ","159":"SSsHirrre! Bagginssss!","160":"There's no Bagginses round here. They're up in Hobbiton.  That way! ","161":"Hey ho, to the bottle I go! To heal my heart and drown my woe. Rain may fall and wind may blow. But there still be \u0096 many miles to go! Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain, and the stream that falls from hill to plain. Better than rain or rippling brook","162":" There's a mug of beer inside this Took! ","163":"There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves, others of a less than savoury nature","164":" War's brewing.  The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.","165":"Children's stories that's all that is. You're beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins! Cracked he was!","166":" Young Mr Frodo here, he's cracking!","167":" and proud of it! Cheers Gaffer! ","168":"Cheers","169":"Well it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your nose out of trouble and no trouble will come to you.

Is it safe ?","177":"Ha!  What are you doing!","178":" Hold out your hand Frodo. Its quite cool.  What can you see ?  Can you see anything ?","179":" Nothing. There's nothing  Wait. There are markings  Its some form of Elvish. I can't read it","180":"There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.","181":"Mordor!","182":"In the common tongue it saysOne Ring to Rule Them All One Ring to find them One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them!","183":" This is the One Ring.  Forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.","184":"Bilbo found it. In Gollum's Cave","185":"Yes, for sixty years the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping prolonging his life. Delaying old age. But no longer Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has awoken. Its heard its master's call.","186":"But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed ","187":"No Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the Ring and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. His orcs have multiplied. His fortress at Barad-D\u00fbr is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands of a second darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it. All his thought is bent on it. The Ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master. They are one, the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo, he must never find it","188":" Alright.  We put it away.  We must never speak of it again. No one knows its here. Do they ? ","189":"There is one other who knew Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum but the enemy found him first.  Admist the endless screams and inane babble they discerned two words.","190":"Shire! Baggins!","191":"Shire! Baggins! But that will lead them here!","192":"Who goes there ? ","193":"Take it Gandalf! ","194":"No Frodo.","195":"You must take it!","196":"You cannot offer me this Ring","197":"I'm giving it to you","198":"Don't! Tempt me Frodo  I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand Frodo I would use this Ring from a desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine","199":"But it cannot stay in The Shire!","200":"No! No it can't","201":" What must I do ?","202":" You must leave, and leave quickly.","203":"Where ? Where do I go ?","204":"Get out of The Shire.  Make for the village of Bree","205":"Bree. What about you ?","206":"I'll be waiting for you. At the Inn of the Prancing Pony","207":" and the Ring will be safe there ?","208":"Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me Frodo, he'll know what to do  You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you. For that name is not safe outside The Shire.  Travel by day and stay off the road","209":"I can cut across country  easily enough","210":"My dear Frodo.  Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all there is to know about them in a month and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you. ","211":"Get down!","212":"Confound you Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping ?","213":"I haven't been dropping no eaves.  Sir honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there. If you follow me","214":"A little late for trimming the verge don't you think ?","215":"I heard raised voices","216":"What did you hear ? Speak!","217":"Nothing important That is I heard a good deal about a ring and a dark lord and something about the end of the world, but please Mr Gandalf Sir, please don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything... unnatural","218":"No ?  Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you.","219":"Come along Samwise, keep up!","220":"Be careful, both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service. Birds, Beasts  Is it safe ?  Never put it on for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power. Always remember Frodo the Ring is trying to get back to its Master. It wants to be found. ","221":" This is it","222":" This is what ?","223":"If I take one more step, it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.","224":" Come on Sam  Remember what Bilbo used to say. Its a dangerous business","225":"Going out your door. You step onto the road and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to ","226":"Sam!","227":" Wood elves!","228":"They're going to the harbour beyond the white towers To the Grey Havens","229":"They're leaving Middle Earth","230":"Never to return","231":"I don't know why.... It makes me sad","232":"Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back","233":" Just shut your eyes and imagine you're back in your own bed, with a soft matress and a lovely feather pillow","234":"Its not working Mr Frodo Oh! I'm never going to be able to sleep out here ","235":" Me neither Sam","236":"Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom The hour grows late and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my Council ","237":"For that is why you have come, is it not ? My old friend","238":"Saruman ","239":"You are sure of this ?","240":"Beyond any doubt","241":"So the Ring of Power has been found","242":"All these long years it was in The Shire under my very nose","243":"and yet you did not have the wits to see it. Your love of the Halflings leaf has clearly slowed your mind","244":"But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly","245":"Time! What time do you think we have ?","246":"Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I speak Gandalf. A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.","247":"The Eye of Sauron","248":"He is gathering all evil to him. Very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle Earth","249":"You know this ? How ?","250":"I have seen it.","251":"A palantir is a dangerous tool Saruman.","252":"Why ? Why should we fear to use it ? ","253":"They are not all accounted for. The lost seeing stones. We do not know who else maybe watching. ","254":"The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving.  The Nine have left Minas Morgul","255":"The Nine!","256":"The crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve disguised as riders in black.","257":"They've reached The Shire?","258":"They will find the Ring and kill the one who carries it.","259":"Frodo ","260":"You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron ? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory.  We must join with him Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise my friend","261":"Tell me. Friend... When did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness ? ","262":"I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly. But you.. have elected.. the way of pain!","263":"Mr Frodo ?  Frodo! Frodo!  I thought I'd lost you","264":"What are you talking about ?","265":"It's just something Gandalf said.","266":"What did he say?","267":"Don't you lose him Samwise Gamgee and I don't mean to.","268":"Sam! We're still in The Shire. What could possibly happen!","269":" Frodo! Merry! Its Frodo Baggins!","270":"Hello Frodo!","271":"Get off him!  Frodo, are you alright?","272":"What's the meaning of this ?","273":"Hold these","274":"You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!","275":"and these","276":"Hoi! You get back here! Wait till I get this through you!  Get out of my fields! You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!","277":"Dunno why he's so upset! Its only a couple of carrots","278":" and some cabbages and those few bags of potatoes that we lifted last week. And the mushrooms the week before.","279":"Yes Pippin, my point is, he's clearly over reacting! Run!","280":" Ooh! that was close!","281":" Oh! I think I've broken something ","282":" Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!","283":"What? It was just a detour. A shortcut","284":"A shortcut to what ?","285":" Mushrooms! ","286":"I think we should get off the road.","287":"Get off the road! Quick!","288":"Ssh.. be quiet","289":"What was that!","290":" Anything ?","291":"Nothing","292":" What is going on ?","293":"That black rider was looking for something. Or someone  Frodo ?","294":" Get down!","295":"I have to leave the Shire.  Sam and I must get to Bree","296":" Right. Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.","297":"Run!","298":"Frodo, this way.

Come on!","307":"Frodo!","308":"Come on faster!","309":"How far to the nearest crossing ?","310":" The Brandywine Bridge, twenty miles.","311":"Come on!","312":"What do you want ?","313":"We're heading for the Prancing Pony.","314":" Hobbits! Four hobbits! What's more out of The Shire by your talk! What business brings you to Bree?","315":"We wish to at the Inn. Our business is our own.","316":" alright young sir, I meant no offence.  My job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk abroad. Can't be too careful ","317":"Out of the way! Watch where you're walking!","318":"Excuse me ?","319":"Good Evening little masters. What can I do for you ? If you're looking for accomodation, we've got some nice, cosy hobbit sized rooms available. Always proud to cater to the little folk, Mr err... ?","320":" Underhill, my name's Underhill","321":"Underhill  yes..","322":"We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we've arrived?","323":"Gandalf ?  Gandalf ? Oh yes! I remember! Elderly chap! Big grey beard, pointy hat.  Not seen him for six months.","324":"What do we do now ?","325":"Sam. He'll be here. He'll come.","326":"What's that ?","327":"This my friend, is a pint! ","328":"It comes in pints ?","329":"hmmmhmmm","330":" I'm getting one!","331":"You've had a whole half already!","332":"That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived! ","333":" Excuse me. That man in the corner. Who is he ?","334":"He's one of them rangers. They're dangerous folk they are. Wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I've never heard, but round here, he's known as Strider.","335":"Strider","336":"Baggins.... Baggins.... Baggins ....Baggins! Baggins!","337":"Baggins ? Sure I know a Baggins! He's over there. Frodo Baggins! He's my second cousin once removed on his mother's side  and my third cousin twice removed on his father's side, if you follow me.","338":" Pippin!","339":" Steady on!","340":"Oh!","341":"You cannot hide!  I see you!  There is no life in the void  Only death!","342":"You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr Underhill!","343":"What do you want ?","344":"A little more caution from you! That is no trinket you carry!","345":"I carry nothing","346":"Indeed  I can avoid being seen if I wish. But to disappear entirely  That is a rare gift!","347":"Who are you ?","348":"Are you frightened?","349":" Yes","350":"Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.","351":" Let him go! Or I'll have you Longshanks!","352":" You have a stout heart little hobbit! But that will not save you. You can no longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They're coming","353":"What are they ?","354":"They were once men. Great Kings of Men. The Sauron the Deciever gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness  Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazg\u00fbl. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead. At all times they feel the presence of the Ring  Drawn to the power of the One  They will never stop hunting you.","355":"Where are you taking us ?","356":"Into the wild","357":" How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ?","358":"I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer, but feel fouler.","359":"He's foul enough ","360":"We have no choice but to trust him","361":" But where is he leading us ?","362":"To Rivendell Master Gamgee. To the House of Elrond.","363":"D'you hear that! Rivendell! We're going to see the elves!","364":"Gentlemen! We do not stop 'til nightfall","365":"What about breakfast ?","366":" You've already had it","367":"We've had one yes. What about second breakfast ?","368":"Don't think he knows about second breakfast Pippin ","369":"What about elvenses ? Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner ? Supper! He knows about them, doesnt he ?","370":"I wouldn't count on it","371":"Pippin!","372":" What are they eating when they can't get hobbit ?","373":" Tin\u00faviel elvanui, Elleth alfirin ethelhael O hon ring finnil fuinui A renc gelebrin thiliol. ","374":" Who is she ? This woman you sing of ?","375":"Tis the Lady of L\u00fathien. The Elf Maiden who gave her love to Beren ... a mortal","376":"What happened to her?","377":" She died.  Get some sleep Frodo","378":"The power of Isengard is at your command","379":"Sauron. Lord of the Earth","380":" Build me an army worthy of Mordor","381":"What orders from Mordor my Lord? What does the Eye command?","382":"We have work to do","383":"The trees are strong my Lord. The roots go deep","384":"Rip them all down","385":"This was the great watch tower of Amon S\u00fbl  We shall rest here tonight.","386":" These are for you. Keep them close, I'm going to have a look round  Stay here ","387":"My tomato's burst!","388":"Can I have some bacon?","389":"OK. Want a tomato Sam ?","390":" What are you doing ?","391":" Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon","392":" Saved some for you Mr Frodo","393":"Put it out you fools!  Put it out!","394":"Well that's nice! That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!","395":"Go!","396":"Backl you Devils! ","397":" Frodo!","398":"Oh Sam!","399":"Strider!  Help him Strider!","400":" He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.  This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs elvish medicine ","401":"Hurry!","402":"It's six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!","403":" Frodo Frodo","404":"GANDALF!","405":" Gwaihir go! Gwaihir","406":"Look Frodo. It's Mr Bilbo's trolls","407":"He's going cold!","408":"Is he going to die ?","409":"He's passing into the Shadow world. He'll soon become a wraith like them.","410":"They're close!","411":"Sam! Do you know the Athelas plant ?","412":"Athelas ?","413":"Kingsfoil","414":"Kingsfoil, aye, its a weed!","415":"It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!","416":"What's this ? a Ranger caught off his guard ? ","417":"Frodo Im Arwen. Telin le thaed. Lasto beth nin.

We must get him to my father.","423":"I've been looking for you for two days.  There are five wraiths behind you, where the other four are I do not know","424":" Dartho guin perian.

I do not fear them","429":" Be iest l\u00een. ","430":"Ride hard. Don't look back","431":"Noro lim, Asfaloth, noro lim! ","432":"What're you doing ? Those wraiths are still out there!","433":"Noro lim Asfaloth! ","434":"Give up the halfling She-elf.","435":" If you want him. Come and claim him","436":"Nin o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer, Rimmo nin Bruinen, dan in Ulair!  Nin o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer, Rimmo nin Bruinen, dan in Ulair! ","437":"No! Frodo! No! Frodo don't give in, not now.","438":"What grace has given me, let it pass to him. Let him be spared","439":"Save him","440":" Lasto beth n\u00een. Tolo dan na ngalad. ","441":" Where am I ?","442":" You are in the House of Elrond  and it is ten o'clock in the morning on October the 24th, if you want to know","443":" Gandalf!","444":" Yes, I am here  and you're lucky to be here too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid,  but you have some strength in you  my dear hobbit","445":" What happened Gandalf ?","446":"Why didn't you meet us ?","447":" Oh, I'm sorry Frodo  I was delayed","448":"The friendship of Sauron is not lightly thrown aside","449":"One ill turn deserves another  it is over","450":"Embrace the power of the Ring, or embrace your own destruction ","451":"There is only Lord of the Ring  Only one who can bend it to his will  and he does not share power ","452":"So you have chosen death","453":"Gandalf ? What is it ?","454":" hmm  Nothing Frodo","455":"Frodo!  Frodo!","456":"Sam!","457":"Bless you, you're awake ","458":" Sam has hardly left your side","459":" We were that worried about you, weren't we Mr Gandalf ?","460":"by the skills of Lord Elrond  you're beginning to mend","461":"Welcome to Rivendell Frodo Baggins","462":" Bilbo!","463":" Hello Frodo my lad","464":" Bilbo","465":"\"There and Back Again... A Hobbits Tale\" by Bilbo Baggins  This is wonderful","466":"I meant to go back. Wander the paths of Mirkwood,  visit Laketown, see the Lonely Mountain again  but age it seems has finally caught up with me","467":"I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else... off with you on one of your adventures...... My own adventure turned out to be quite different  I'm not like you Bilbo","468":" My dear boy","469":"Now what have I forgotten","470":"Packed already ?","471":" No harm in being prepared","472":"I thought you wanted to see the elves Sam ","473":"I do","474":"More than anything","475":"I did. Its just  We did what Gandalf wanted didn't we ? We got the Ring this far to Rivendell and I thought... seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon ..... off home","476":"You're right Sam  We did what we set out to do  the Ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home","477":"His strength returns","478":"That wound will never fully heal, he will carry it for the rest of his life ","479":"And yet to come so far, still bearing the Ring, the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil ","480":"It is a burden he should never have had to bear.  we can ask no more of Frodo","481":" Gandalf! The enemy is moving Sauron's forces are massing in the east, his eye is fixed on Rivendell ..... and Saruman you tell me has betrayed us...  Our list of allies grows thin!","482":"His treachery runs deeper than you know.  By foul craft Saruman has crossed orcs with goblin men, he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight and gather great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring.","483":"This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard  Gandalf! the Ring cannot stay here","484":"This peril belongs to all in Middle Earth they must decide now how to end.","485":"The time of the elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we've gone ? The dwarves ? They hide in their mountains seaking riches, they care nothing for the troubles of others","486":" It is in men we must place our hope","487":"Men!  Men are weak  the race of men is failing. The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity all but forgotten. It is because of men the Ring survives. I was there Gandalf  I was there three thousand years ago  when Isildur took the Ring. I was there the day the strength of men failed  Isildur hurry, follow me  I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom  Come!","488":"Where the Ring was forged. The one place it could be destroyed ","489":" Cast it into the fire","490":"Destroy it!","491":"No ","492":"Isildur! ","493":"It should have ended that day but evil was allowed to endure ","494":" Isildur kept the Ring. The line of Kings is broken. There's no strength left in the world of men. They're scattered, divided, leaderless","495":"There is one who could unite them. One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor","496":"He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile","497":"You are no elf","498":"Men of the South are welcome here","499":" Who are you ?","500":"I'm a friend of Gandalf the Grey","501":" Then we are here on a common purpose  friend.","502":"The shards of Narsil  The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand  Ah!  Its still sharp  but no more than a broken heirloom ","503":"Why do you fear the past. You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate","504":"The same blood flows in my veins  The same weakness","505":" Your time will come. You will face the same evil and you will defeat it A si i-Dh\u00faath \u00fa-orthor, Aragorn. \u00da or le a \u00fa or nin. ","506":"Renech i lu i erui govannen? ","507":"Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen. ","508":" Gwenwin in enninath...U-arnech in naeth i si celich.  Renech i beth i pennen? ","509":" You said you would bind yourself to me  foresaking the immortal life of your people","510":"and to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone","511":"I choose a mortal life","512":"You cannot give me this","513":"It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart ","514":"Strangers from distant lands, friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle Earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.  Bring forth the Ring, Frodo","515":" So it's true","516":"In a dream  I saw the Eastern sky grow dark  In the West a pale light lingered A voice was crying, your doom is near at hand  Isildur's bane is found  Isildur's Bane","517":"Boromir!","518":"Ash nazg durbatul\u00fbk, ash nazg gimbatul,  ash nazg thrakatul\u00fbk  agh burzum-ishi krimpatul. ","519":" Never before has anyone uttered words of that tongue here in Imladris","520":"I do not ask your pardon Master Elrond for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West  The Ring is altogether evil ","521":" Aye it is a gift!  A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this Ring ?  Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor kept the forces of Mordor at bey. By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy, let us use it against him","522":"You cannot wield it. None of us can  The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master","523":" and what would a ranger know of this matter ?","524":" This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn son of Arathorn You owe him your allegiance","525":" Aragorn! This.. is Isildur's heir","526":"and heir to the throne of Gondor","527":"Havo dad, Legolas ","528":" Gondor has no King.  Gondor needs no King ","529":"Aragorn is right. We cannot use it","530":" You have only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed.","531":"Then what are we waiting for","532":"The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the firey chasm from whence it came.  One of you........... must do this","533":"One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the great eye is ever watchful. Tis a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this.  It is folly","534":" Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed","535":"and I suppose you think you're the one to do it.","536":"and if we fail what then ?  What happens when Sauron takes back what is his ?","537":" I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf","538":"Never trust an elf","539":"Do you not understand that while we bicker amongst ourselves, Sauron's power grows?! None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed","540":" I will take it  I will take it  I will take the Ring to Mordor  Tho, I do not know the way","541":"I will help you bear this burden Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear. ","542":" If by my life or death I can protect you, I will  You have my sword","543":"and you have my bow ","544":"and my axe ","545":"You carry the fate of us all little one.  If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done","546":"Mr Frodo's not going anywhere without me","547":"No indeed it is hardly possible to seperate you, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not!","548":"Wait! we're coming too!","549":"You'd have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us","550":"Anyway you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission ...........quest ..........thing","551":"Well that rules you out Pip","552":" Nine companions... So be it! You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring!","553":"Great! Where are we going?","554":"Anirne hene beriad i ch\u00ean \u00een. Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen. ","555":"In her heart your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life","556":" but you'd never escape your fate. The skill of the elves can reforge the sword of Kings, but only you have the power to wield it. ","557":"I do not want that power, I have never wanted it","558":"You are the last of that blood line, there is no other","559":"My old sword, Sting  Here, take it, take it.","560":"Its so light!","561":"Yes Yes  Made by the elves you know. The blade glows blue when orcs are close and its times like that my lad, when you have to be extra careful. Here's a pretty thing.  Mithril!  as light as a feather and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put it on, go on.","562":" My my old ring. Well I should... very much like to hold it again, one last time.","563":"I'm sorry I brought this upon you my boy  I'm sorry that you must carry this burden . I'm sorry for everything","564":"The Ringbearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom and you who travel with him,  no oath nor bond is laid to go further than you will  Farewell. Hold to your purpose and may the blessings of elves , and men , and all free folk  go with you. ","565":"The Fellowship awaits the Ringbearer.","566":"Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right ?","567":" Left.","568":"We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for forty days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.  and there are road turns east to Mordor.","569":"Good, very good. ","570":"Move your feet","571":"You look good Pippin","572":" Thanks ","573":" If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note that they're not, I'd say that we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.","574":"No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.","575":"ARGH!","576":"Sorry! ","577":"Get him! ","578":"For the Shire. Hold him, hold him down Merry! ","579":" Gentlemen, that's enough! ","580":"You've got my arm... argh!... you've got my arm","581":"What is that ?","582":"Nothing, its just a whisp of cloud","583":" Its moving fast.... against the wind","584":"Crebain! From Dudland!","585":"Hide! ","586":"Hurry!","587":" Frodo! Take cover!","588":"Spies of Saruman. The passage south is being watched  We must take the Pass of Caradhras ","589":"Frodo! ","590":"Boromir","591":"It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing  such a little thing ","592":" Boromir!  Give the Ring to Frodo","593":" as you wish! I care not ","594":"So Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails, where then will you go ?","595":"If the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous road","596":"Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; nai yarvaxea rasselya! ","597":"There is a fell voice on the air","598":"It's Saruman!","599":"He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf! We must turn back!","600":"No!  Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith! ","601":" Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea rasselya; taltuva notto-carinnar! ","602":"We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the west road to my city!","603":"The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!","604":"If we cannot pass over the mountain, let us go under it! Let us go through the Mines of Moria","605":"Moria... you fear to go into those mines.","606":" the dwarves delved too greadily and too deep","607":" You know what they woke in the dark of Khazad-d\u00fbm","608":" Shadow, flame","609":"Let the Ringbearer decide","610":"We cannot stay here!  This will be the death of the hobbits!","611":"Frodo ?","612":" We will go through the Mines","613":"So be it","614":"Frodo, come and help an old man  How's your shoulder?","615":" Better than it was","616":"and the Ring ?  You feel its power growing don't you. I've felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship and I fear from within. ","617":"Who then do I trust ?","618":"You must trust to yourself. Trust your own strength.","619":"What do you mean ?","620":"There are many powers in this world for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am and against some I have not yet been tested","621":" Ah! The walls of Moria!","622":"Dwarf doors are invisible when closed ","623":"Yes Gimli! Their own masters cannot find them, if their secrets are forgotten!","624":"Why doesn't that surprise me!","625":"Ach!","626":"Ah... now let me see.... Ithildin  It mirrors only starlight... and moonlight","627":"It reads \"The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria, Speak Friend and Enter\"","628":"What do you suppose that means ?","629":"Oh it's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open  Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! ","630":"Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen. ","631":" Nothing's happening","632":" I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves, men and orcs","633":"What're you going to do then ?","634":"Knock your head against these doors Peregrin Took! and if that does not shatter them and I'm allowed a little peace from foolish questions I will try to find the opening words.","635":"Ando Eldarinwa a lasta quettanya, Fenda Casarinwa ","636":"The Mines are no place for a pony even one so brave as Bill.","637":"BuBye Bill","638":"Go on, go on  Don't worry Sam. He knows the way home. ","639":" Do not disturb the water ","640":" Oh it's useless","641":"It's a riddle!","642":"Speak friend... and enter. What's the elvish word for friend ?","643":"Mel..lon","644":"Soon Mr Elf, you will enjoy the fabelled hospitality of the dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt Beer! Red Meat off the bone!","645":"This my friend is the home of my cousin Balin and they call it a Mine!","646":"A Mine!","647":" This isn't a mine, it's a tomb","648":" Nooooo! NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo!","649":" Goblins! ","650":"We make for the gap of Rohan. We should never have come here","651":"Now get out of here! Get out!","652":"Frodo! Frodo!","653":"Strider!  Get off him!","654":"Aragorn!","655":"Frodo!","656":"Strider!","657":"Into the Mines!","658":"Legolas!","659":"We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world  Quietly now, its a four day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.","660":"The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril","661":"Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him","662":"Aww that was a Kingly gift","663":"Yes. I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of The Shire! ","664":"Pippin!","665":"I've no memory of this place","666":"Are we lost ?","667":"No","668":"I think we are","669":"Ssh! Gandalf's thinking","670":"Merry!","671":"What!","672":"I'm hungry","673":"There's something down there","674":"It's Gollum","675":"Gollum!","676":"He's been following us for three days","677":"He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D\u00fbr!","678":"Escaped  or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here  He won't ever be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story . Yes  he was once called, before the Ring found him. Before it drove him mad","679":"It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance","680":"Pity ? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over.  The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many ","681":"I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.","682":"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.  Oh! Its that way","683":"He's remembered ","684":" No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.","685":"Let me risk a little more light  Behold the great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf.","686":"There's an eye-opener and no mistake","687":"Oh!","688":"Gimli!","689":"No, no  no","690":"Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.  He is dead then.  Its as I feared.","691":" We must move on, we cannot linger.","692":" They have taken the Bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums  Drums in the deep. We cannot get out.  A shadow moves in the dark.  We cannot get out. They are coming.","693":" Fool of a Took!  Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!","694":"Frodo!","695":"Orcs!","696":" Get back! and stay close to Gandalf.","697":"They have a cave troll!","698":"Agh! Let them come There's one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.","699":"Pull!","700":"Think I'm getting the hang of this.","701":"Frodo!","702":"Aragorn!  Aragorn!","703":"Frodo!","704":"Frodo!","705":"Frodo!","706":"Oh no!","707":" He's alive!","708":"I'm alright. I'm not hurt.","709":"You should be dead. That spear would have skewered a wild boar","710":"I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye.","711":" Mithril! You are full of surprises Master Baggins!","712":"To the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm","713":"What is this new devilment ?","714":"A balrog, a demon of the ancient world. Its foe is beyond any of you RUN!","715":" Gandalf!","716":"Lead them on Aragorn. The Bridge is near!","717":" Do as I say!  Swords are of no more use here.","718":" Gandalf!","719":"Merry! Pippin! ","720":"Sam! ","721":" Nobody tosses a dwarf!  Mind the beard!","722":" Steady! Hold on!","723":" Hang on!","724":"Lean forward!","725":" Come on!","726":"Over the Bridge!  Fly!","727":"You cannot pass!","728":" Gandalf!","729":"I am the Servant of the Secret Fire. Wielder of the Flame of Anor.","730":"The dark fire will not avail you.  Flame of Ud\u00fbn!","731":"Go back to the shadow!","732":"You shall not pass! ","733":"No!","734":"Gandalf!","735":" Fly you fools! ","736":"NOOoooooooooooooo!","737":"Aragorn! ","738":"Legolas! Get them up!","739":"Give them a moment! For pities sake!","740":"By nightfall this hills will be swarming with orcs! We must reach the woods of Lothl\u00f3rien. Come, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up !  On your feet Sam,  Frodo ?  Frodo!","741":" Stay close young hobbits.  They say there's a great sorceress lives in these woods. An Elf-witch of terrible power. All who look upon her fall under her spell...","742":"Frodo!  Frodo!","743":"..and are never seen again","744":"Your coming to us  is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here!  Ringbearer!","745":"Mr Frodo ?","746":"Well! Here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily! I have the eyes of a hawk, and ears of a fox!","747":"Oh!","748":" The dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.","749":"Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion. ","750":"Govannas v\u00een gwennen le, Haldir o L\u00f3rien. ","751":"A, Aragorn in D\u00fanedain istannen le ammen. ","752":" Haldir","753":"So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves! Speak words we can also understand!","754":"We have not had dealings with the dwarves, since the dark days.","755":"And do you know what this Dwarf says to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! ","756":" That! was not so courteous!","757":" You bring great evil with you  You can go no further!","758":"Boe ammen veriad l\u00een. Andelu i ven! ","759":"Merin le telim.  Henio, an\u00edron boe ammen i dulu l\u00een! ","760":"Aragorn! ","761":" Andelu i ven. ","762":"Gandalf's death was not in vain. Nor would he have you give up hope You carry a heavy burden Frodo. Don't carry the weight of the dead.","763":" You will follow me.","764":" Caras Galadhon. The heart of Elvendom on earth. Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.","765":" The Enemy knows you have entered here. What hope you had in secrecy is now gone. Eight that are here yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak with him. I can no longer see him from afar.","766":" Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land. He has fallen into Shadow. ","767":" He was taken by both Shadow and flame. A Balrog of Morgoth. For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.","768":" Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his full purpose.  Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-d\u00fbm fill your heart, Gimli, son of Gl\u00f3in. For the world has grown full of peril. And in all lands love is now mingled with grief.","769":" What now becomes of this Fellowship? Without Gandalf, hope is lost.","770":" The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while the Company is true.","771":" Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Tonight you will sleep in peace\u2026  Welcome Frodo of the Shire. One who has seen the Eye!","772":" A lament for Gandalf.","773":" What do they say about him?","774":" I have not the heart to tell you. For me the grief is still too near.","775":" I bet they don\u2019t mention his fireworks. There should be a verse about them. \u201cThe finest rockets ever seen. They burst in stars of blue and green. Or after thunder, silver showers \u2026 Came falling like a\u2026rain of flowers\u201d Oh, that doesn\u2019t do them justice by a long road.","776":" Take some rest. These borders are well-protected.","777":" I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me \u201cEven now there is hope left.\u201d But I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope. My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing. And now our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right and I would do it. I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it Aragorn? The White tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? ","778":" I have seen the White City, long ago.","779":" One day, our paths will lead us there. And the tower guards shall take up the call: \u201cThe Lords of Gondor have returned!\u201d","780":" Will you look into the mirror?","781":" What will I see?","782":" Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror shows many things.","783":" Things that were, things that are and some things\u2026  that have not yet come to pass.","784":" I know what it is you saw. For it is also in my mind.  It is what will come to pass if you should fail. The Fellowship is breaking. It has already begun. He will try to take the Ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one it will destroy them all.","785":"  If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring.","786":" You offer it to me freely. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.","787":" In place of a dark lord, you will have a queen! Not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as the sea! Stronger than the foundations of the Earth! All shall love me and despair!","788":" I pass the test! I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel.","789":" I cannot do this alone.","790":" You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power is to be alone.  This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant. And I am its keeper. This task was appointed to you. And if you do not find a way, no one will.","791":" Then I know what I must do. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m afraid to do it.","792":" Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.","793":" Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?  They were elves once, taken by the dark powers. Tortured and mutilated.. A ruined and terrible form of life. Now\u2026perfected.. my fighting Uruk-Hai. Whom do you serve?","794":" Saruman!","795":"  Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste man flesh!","796":" One of the halflings carries something of great value. Bring them to me alive and unspoiled. Kill the others!","797":" Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people. May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.","798":" Lembas. Elvish waybread. One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. ","799":" How many did you eat?","800":" Four.","801":" Every league you travel south, the danger will increase. Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin. Nor will you find safety on the western bank. Strange creatures bearing the white hand have been seen on our borders. Seldom do Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so.  Le aphadar aen. *You are being tracked* By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.","802":" My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim. Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.  These are the daggers of the Noldorin. They have already seen service in war. Do not fear, young Peregrin Took. You will find your courage. And for you, Samwise Gamgee, Elven rope made of hithlain.","803":" Thank you, my lady. Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?","804":" And what gift would a dwarf ask of the Elves?","805":" Nothing. Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time, for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.  Actually, there was one thing.  No, no, I couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s quite impossible. Stupid to ask\u2026","806":"  I have nothing greater to give than the gift you already bear.  Am meleth d\u00een, i ant e guil Arwen Und\u00f3miel p\u00edgatha. *For her love, I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.*","807":" An\u00edron i e broniatha, ad ae periatham athar i methid en-amar hen. An\u00edron i e c\u00edratha na Valannor. *I would have her leave these shores and be with her people. I would have her take the ship to Valinor.*","808":" That choice is yet before her. You have your own choice to make, Aragorn. To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil, or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin. Nam\u00e1ri\u00eb. *Farewell.* Nadath n\u00e2 i moe cerich. Dan, \u00fa-\u2018eveditham, Elessar. *There is much you have left to do. We will not meet again, Elessar.*","809":"  Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of E\u00e4rendil, our most beloved star.","810":"  May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.","811":" I have taken my worst wound at this parting, having looked my last upon that which is fairest. Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.","812":" What was her gift?","813":" I asked her for one hair from her golden head. She gave me three.","814":" Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria. I had hoped we would lose him on the river. But he\u2019s too clever a waterman.","815":" And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts, it will make the crossing even more dangerous.","816":" Have some food, Mr. Frodo.","817":" No, Sam.","818":" You haven\u2019t eaten anything all day. You\u2019re not sleeping neither. Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed. Mr. Frodo-","819":" I\u2019m all right.","820":" But you\u2019re not. I\u2019m here to help you. I promised Gandalf that I would.","821":" You can\u2019t help me Sam. Not this time. Get some sleep.","822":" Minas Tirith is the safer road. You know that. From there we can regroup. Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.","823":" There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.","824":" You were quick enough to trust the Elves. Have you so little faith in your own people? Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men. But you will not see that.  You are afraid! All your life, you have hidden in the shadows. Scared of who you are, of what you are.","825":" I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city.","826":" Frodo. The Argonath! Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old. My kin.","827":" We cross the lake at nightfall. Hide the boats and continue on foot. We approach Mordor from the north.","828":" Oh, yes? It\u2019s just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil? An impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks! And after that, it gets even better!  Festering, stinking marshlands far as the eye can see.","829":" That is our road. I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.","830":" Recover my\u2026?! Grrrrrr.","831":" We should leave now.","832":" No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.","833":" It is not the eastern shore that worries me. A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near. I can feel it.","834":" Recover strength?  Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.","835":" Where\u2019s Frodo?","836":" None of us should wander alone. You, least of all. So much depends on you. Frodo? I know why you seek solitude. You suffer, I see it day by day. You sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo. Other paths that we might take.","837":" I know what you would say. It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.","838":" Warning? Against what? We\u2019re all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have, don\u2019t you see that is madness?","839":" There is no other way!","840":" I ask only for the strength to defend my people!  If you would but lend me the Ring\u2026","841":" No! ","842":" Why do you recoil? I am no thief.","843":" You are not yourself.","844":" What chance do you think you have? They will find you. They will take the Ring. And you will beg for death before the end!","845":" You fool!","846":" It is not yours save by unhappy chance! It could have been mine!  It should be mine! Give it to me!","847":" Give it to me!","848":" No!","849":" Give it to me!","850":" No!","851":" I see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron! You will betray us! You go to your death, and to the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you and all the Halflings!","852":" Frodo? Frodo? What have I done? Please, Frodo.","853":"  Frodo, I\u2019m sorry!","854":" Frodo?","855":" It has taken Boromir.","856":" Where is the Ring?","857":" Stay away!","858":" Frodo!","859":" I swore to protect you.","860":" Can you protect me from yourself?","861":" Would you destroy it?","862":" Aragorn\u2026Aragorn\u2026Elessar\u2026","863":" I would have gone with you to the end. Into the very fires of Mordor.","864":" I know. Look after the others. Especially Sam. He will not understand.","865":" Go, Frodo.","866":" Run.","867":" Run!","868":" Mr.Frodo!","869":"  Find the Halfling! Find the Halfling!","870":" Elendil!","871":" Aragorn, go!","872":" Frodo!","873":" Hide here. Quick! Come on!","874":"  What\u2019s he doing?","875":" He\u2019s leaving.","876":" No!","877":" Pippin!","878":"  Run, Frodo! Go on!","879":" Hey! Hey, you! Over here!","880":" Hey!","881":" Over here!","882":"  This way!","883":" It\u2019s working!","884":" I know its working! Run!","885":" The Horn of Gondor.","886":" Boromir.","887":"  Run! Run!","888":" Shire!","889":" No.","890":" They took the little ones.","891":" Hold still.","892":" Frodo. Where is Frodo?","893":" I let Frodo go.","894":" Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the Ring from him.","895":" The Ring is beyond our reach now.","896":" Forgive me. I did not see it. I have failed you all.","897":" No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor.","898":" Leave it! It is over. The world of Men will fall. And all will come to darkness, and my city to ruin.","899":" I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you I will not let the White City fall, nor our people fail.","900":" Our people? Our people.","901":" I would have followed you, my brother. My captain. My king.","902":" Be at peace, son of Gondor.","903":" They will look for his coming from the White Tower. But he will not return.","904":" Frodo!","905":"  I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.","906":"  So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.","907":" Frodo, no! Frodo! Mr. Frodo!","908":"  No Sam.","909":" Go back, Sam! I\u2019m going to Mordor alone.","910":" Of course you are! And I\u2019m coming with you!","911":" You can\u2019t swim! Sam!","912":" Sam!","913":" I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise: \u201cDon\u2019t you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.\u201d And I don\u2019t mean to. I don\u2019t mean to.","914":" Oh Sam!","915":" Come on.","916":" Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.","917":" You mean not to follow them.","918":" Frodo\u2019s fate is no longer in our hands.","919":" Then it has all been in vain. The Fellowship has failed.","920":" Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death. Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind. We travel light. Let\u2019s hunt some Orc.","921":" Yes! Haha!","922":" Mordor. I hope the others find a safer route.","923":" Strider will look after them.","924":" I don\u2019t suppose we\u2019ll ever see them again.","925":" We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may.","926":" Sam, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re with me.","927":"You cannot pass!","928":"Gandalf!","929":"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. Go back to the Shadow.The dark fire will not avail you,flame of Udun!","930":"You shall not pass!","931":" No! No!","932":"Gandalf!","933":"Fly, you fools!","934":"No!Gandalf!","935":"Gandalf!","936":"What is it, Mr. Frodo?","937":"Nothing.Just a dream.","938":"Can you see the bottom?","939":"No! Don't look down, Sam!Just keep going!","940":"Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!","941":"Mr. Frodo!","942":"I think I've found the bottom.","943":"Bogs and rope,and goodness knows what.It's not natural. None of it.","944":"What's in this?","945":"Nothing.Just a bit of seasoning.I thought maybe if we was havinga roast chicken one night or something.","946":"Roast chicken?!","947":"You never know.","948":"Sam. My dear Sam.","949":"It's very special, that.It's the best salt in all the Shire.","950":"It is special. It's a little bit of home.","951":"We can't leave this here for someoneto follow us down.","952":"Who's gonna follow us down here,Mr. Frodo?It's a shame, really.Lady Galadriel gave me that.Real Elvish rope. Well, there's nothing for it.It's one of my knots.Won't come free in a hurry.","953":"Real Elvish rope.","954":"Mordor. The one place in Middle-earthwe don't want to see any closer.And it's the one placewe're trying to get to.It's just where we can't get. Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.I don't think Gandalf meant for us tocome this way.","955":"He didn't mean for a lot of thingsto happen, Sam......but they did.","956":"Mr. Frodo?It's the Ring, isn't it?","957":"It's getting heavier.","958":"What food have we got left?","959":"Let me see.Oh, yes. Lovely.Lembas bread. And look!More lembas bread.","960":"I don't usually hold with foreign food.....but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.","961":"Nothing ever dampens your spirits,does it, Sam?","962":"Those rain clouds might.","963":"This looks strangely familiar.","964":"It's because we've been here before.We're going in circles.","965":"What is that horrid stink?I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?","966":"Yes.....I can smell it.................We're not alone.","967":"The thieves............... The thieves.The filthy little thieves.Where is it?.............Where is it?They stole it from us.............My precious.........Curse them, we hates them!It's ours, it is, and we wants it!","968":"This is Sting.You've seen it before......haven't you, Gollum?Release him or I'll cut your throat.","969":"Yessssss","970":"It burns!It burns us!It freezes!Nasty Elves twisted it.","971":"Take it off us!","972":"Quiet, you!It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor'sgoing to hear this racket. Let's just tie him up and leave him.","973":"No!That would kill us! Kill us!","974":"It's no more than you deserve!","975":"Maybe he does deserve to die.But now that I see him, I do pity him.","976":"We be nice to themif they be nice to us.Take it off us.We swears to do what you wants................We swears.","977":"There's no promise you can makethat I can trust.","978":"We swears......to serve the master ...........of the precious. We will swear on.....on the precious,Gollum. Gollum.","979":"The Ring is treacherous.It will hold you to your word.","980":"Yes......on the precious.....On the precious.","981":"I don't believe you!","982":"Get down! I said, down!","983":"Sam!","984":"He's trying to trick us.If we let him go, he'll throttle usin our sleep.","985":"You know the way to Mordor?","986":"Yes.","987":"You've been there before?","988":"Yes.","989":"You will lead us to the Black Gate.","990":"To the Gate, to the Gate!To the Gate, the master says. Yes!","991":"No! We won't go back.Not there. Not to him.They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!","992":"But we swore to serve the masterof the precious.","993":"No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,and pits, pits, pits.And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.And always the Great Eye watching,watching.","994":"Hey! Come back now! Come back!There! What did I tell you?He's run off, the old villain.So much for his promises.","995":"This way, Hobbits.Follow me!","996":"Merry!Merry!","997":"You're lateOur master grows impatient.He wants the Shire-rats now.","998":"I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.Saruman will have his prize.We will deliver them.","999":"Merry!

I fooled you too.Don't worry about me, Pippin.","1013":"What is it? What do you smell?","1014":"Man-flesh","1015":"They've picked up our trail.","1016":" Aragorn.","1017":"Let's move!","1018":"Their pace has quickened.They must have caught our scent.Hurry!","1019":"Come on, Gimli!","1020":" Three days and nights pursuit.No food. No rest.And no sign of our quarry,but what bare rock can tell.","1021":"Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.","1022":" They may yet be alive.","1023":"Less than a day ahead of us. Come.","1024":"Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!","1025":"I'm wasted on cross-country.We Dwarves are natural sprinters.Very dangerous over short distances.","1026":"Rohan.Home of the Horse-lords.There's something strange at work here.Some evil gives speedto these creatures.Sets its will against us.","1027":"Legolas!

We have only to remove those who oppose us.","1033":"I want them armed and ready to marchwithin two weeks!","1034":"But, my lord, there are too many!They cannot all be armed in time,we don't have the means.","1035":"Build a dam, block the stream,work the furnaces night and day.","1036":"We don't have enough fuelto feed the fires.","1037":"The Forest of Fangornlies on our doorstep. Burn it.","1038":"Yes.","1039":"We will fight for you.","1040":"Swear it.","1041":"We will die for Saruman.","1042":"The Horse-Men took your lands.They drove your people into the hillsto scratch a living off rocks.","1043":"Murderers!","1044":"Take back the lands they stole from you.Burn every village!","1045":"We have only to remove thosewho oppose us.It will begin in Rohan.Too long have these peasantsstood against you.But no more.","1046":"Eothain!

The king's mind is enslaved,it's an old device of Saruman's.His hold over King Theodenis now very strong.Sauron and Sarumanare tightening the noose.But for all their cunning......we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden.And that we should seek to destroy it......has not yet enteredtheir darkest dreams.

No, master!They catch you!

There's another way.More secret. A dark way.","1265":"Why haven't you spoken of this before?","1266":"Because master did not ask.","1267":"He's up to something.","1268":"Are you saying there's another wayinto Mordor?","1269":"Yes.

Especially now that your brother has deserted you.","1315":"Leave me alone, snake!","1316":"Oh, but you are alone.

There won't be a Shire, Pippin.","1749":"Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!","1750":"Nan Barad! Nan Barad!  Haldir, nan Barad! ","1751":"What are you doing? What are you stopping for?","1752":"Nan Barad! ","1753":"Haldir!","1754":"Brace the gate!","1755":"Hold them!","1756":"To the gate. Draw your swords!","1757":"Make way!  We cannot hold much longer!","1758":"Hold them!","1759":" How long do you need?","1760":"As long as you can give me. ","1761":" Gimli!","1762":"Timbers! Brace the gate!","1763":"Come on. We can take them.","1764":"It's a long way.","1765":" Toss me.","1766":"What?","1767":" I cannot jump the distance! You'll have to toss me!","1768":" Don't tell the Elf.","1769":"Not a word. ","1770":"Shore up the door!","1771":"Make way!","1772":"Follow me to the barricade.","1773":"Watch our backs!","1774":"Throw another one over here!","1775":"Higher!","1776":"Hold fast the gate!","1777":" Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there! ","1778":" Aragorn!","1779":"Pull everybody back. Pull them back.","1780":"Fall back! Fall back!","1781":"They have broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat!","1782":"Fall back!","1783":"Retreat!","1784":"Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!","1785":"Into the Keep!","1786":"I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there.","1787":"Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south.","1788":"South? But that will lead you past lsengard.","1789":"Yes. Exactly.  If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It's the last thing he'll expect.","1790":" That doesn't make sense to me. But then......you are very small.  Perhaps you're right. South it is, then. Hold on, little Shirelings.  I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill.","1791":" Are you mad? We'll be caught.","1792":" No, we won't. Not this time.","1793":"Look! Osgiliath burns!","1794":"Mordor has come.","1795":" The Ring will not save Gondor.  It has only the power to destroy. Please......Iet me go.","1796":"Hurry.","1797":"Faramir! You must let me go!","1798":"And those little family of field mice......that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.","1799":"They're always trying to get somewhere where they....","1800":"Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.","1801":"I'm sorry, Treebeard.","1802":"They had voices of their own.","1803":" Saruman. A wizard should know better! ","1804":"There is no curse in Elvish......Entish or the tongues of Men......for this treachery.","1805":"Look! The trees! They're moving!","1806":"Where are they going?","1807":"They have business with the Orcs. My business is with lsengard tonight......with rock and stone.","1808":"Yes!","1809":"Come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely......that we go to our doom. Last march......of the Ents.","1810":"Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall we will be overrun.","1811":"Mr. Frodo?","1812":"It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me. ","1813":"Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.","1814":"Take them to my father.  Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.  A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war. ","1815":"Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?  You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!  He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!","1816":"Watch out!","1817":"Mr. Frodo?","1818":"They're here.","1819":"They've come.","1820":"Nazgul!","1821":"Stay here. Keep out of sight.  Take cover!","1822":"The fortress is taken. It is over.","1823":" You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. They still defend it. They have died defending it.","1824":"They are breaking in!","1825":"They're past the door!","1826":" Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? ","1827":" Is there no other way?","1828":"There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.","1829":" Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance!","1830":" So much death.  What can Men do against such reckless hate?","1831":"Ride out with me.  Ride out and meet them.","1832":"For death and glory.","1833":"For Rohan. For your people.","1834":"The sun is rising.","1835":"Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn......Iook to the east.","1836":"Yes.........Yes.........The horn of Helm Hammerhand......shall sound in the Deep......one last time.","1837":"Yes!","1838":" Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.","1839":"Fell deeds, awake. Now for wrath......now for ruin and a red dawn.","1840":"Forth Eorlingas!","1841":"Gandalf.","1842":" Theoden King stands alone.","1843":" Not alone.  Rohirrim!","1844":"Eomer.","1845":"To the king!","1846":"Yes!","1847":"A hit. A fine hit.","1848":"Break the dam! Release the river!","1849":"Pippin! Hold on!","1850":"Hold on, little Hobbits.","1851":"What are you doing?","1852":"Where are you going?","1853":"It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam?","1854":"I can't do this, Sam.","1855":" I know. It's all wrong.  By rights, we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.  Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.....because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was...... when so much bad had happened?","1856":"Victory! We have victory!","1857":"But in the end, it's only a passing thing...... this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you......that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.","1858":"Folk in those stories......had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going......because they were holding on to something.","1859":"What are we holding on to, Sam?","1860":"That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.","1861":"I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins. ","1862":"You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.","1863":"Then it is forfeit. Release them.","1864":"Stay out of the forest! Keep away from the trees!","1865":" Final count.....42.","1866":"Forty-two? That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I myself am sitting pretty on 43.","1867":" Forty-three.","1868":"He was already dead.","1869":"He was twitching.","1870":"He was twitching......because he's got my axe  embedded in his nervous system!","1871":"He doesn't look too happy, does he?","1872":"Not too happy at all, Merry.","1873":"Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.","1874":"Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment. I hear the staff are very good.","1875":"What are you doing?","1876":"Nothing. The world's back to normal, that's all.","1877":"No, it isn't. I'm starving.","1878":"Good luck trying to find something decent around here.  Probably only dead rats and mouldy bread.","1879":"Saruman's storeroom!","1880":"I don't believe it.","1881":"It can't be.","1882":"lt is!","1883":"Longbottom Leaf.  The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.","1884":" It's perfect. One barrel each.  Wait. Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?","1885":" Share it?  No. No.  Dead plant and all that. Don't think he'd understand.  Could be a distant relative.","1886":" I get it. Don't be hasty. ","1887":" Exactly.  Bar-hrum. ","1888":"This is the old sewer. Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city. You'll find cover in the woods there.","1889":"Captain Faramir......you have shown your quality, sir.","1890":"The very highest.","1891":" The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee......where gardeners are held in high honor.","1892":"What road will you take once you reach the woods?","1893":"Gollum says there's a path......near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.","1894":"Cirith Ungol?","1895":"ls that its name?","1896":"No.  No!  Yes.","1897":" Frodo......they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. You cannot go that way.","1898":"lt is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.","1899":"I must.","1900":" Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.","1901":"Thank you.","1902":"May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.","1903":"Come on, keep up.","1904":"Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you? He was trying to save you, see?","1905":" Save me?","1906":"So there's no hard feelings. Forgive and forget.","1907":"No, no, no hard feelings. Gollum, Gollum.  Yes, master. Nice Hobbits.","1908":" Very decent of you. Very decent, indeed, Gollum.","1909":"Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.","1910":"The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.","1911":" All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...","1912":"...somewhere in the wilderness.","1913":"I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.","1914":" What?","1915":"I wonder if people will ever say, \"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.\" And they'll say, \"Yes! That's one of my favourite stories.\" \"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? \" \"Yes, my boy.  The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot.\"","1916":" Well, you've left out one of the chief characters: \"Samwise the Brave.\" I want to hear more about Sam.","1917":" Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.","1918":"Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious.","1919":"So was l. ","1920":" \"Samwise the Brave.\" ","1921":"Smeagol?","1922":"We're not going to wait for you. Come on.","1923":"Master. Master looks after us.  Master wouldn't hurt us.","1924":"Master broke his promise.","1925":"Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol.","1926":"Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False.  We ought to wring his filthy little neck.  Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both!  And then we take the precious......and we be the master!","1927":" But the fat Hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.","1928":" Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.","1929":"Yes. Yes. Yes.","1930":"Kill them both.","1931":"Yes.  No! No!  It's too risky. It's too risky.","1932":"Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?","1933":"Smeagol?","1934":"We could let her do it.","1935":"Yes. She could do it.","1936":"Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead.","1937":"Once they're dead.  Ssssssssssssssh!","1938":"Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.  Smeagol will show you the way.","1939":"Follow me.","1940":"Oh Smeagol Ive got one!  Ive got a fish Smeagol, Smeagol! ","1941":"Pull it in! Go on, go on, go on, pull it in!","1942":"Arrghh! ","1943":"Deagol!","1944":"Deagol!","1945":"Deagol!","1946":"Give us that! Deagol my love","1947":"Why?","1948":"Because\u2026  it\u2019s my birthday and I wants it.","1949":"My precious.","1950":"They cursed us","1951":"Murderer)","1952":"\u201cMurderer\u201d they called us. They cursed us and drove us away. ","1953":"Gollum\u2026 Gollum\u2026 Gollum\u2026  and we wept precious. We wept to be so alone.","1954":"and cool, so nice for feet\u2026 and we only wish to catch a fish  so juicy sweet.","1955":"And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees and the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name.","1956":"My precious!","1957":"Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once.","1958":"Haven\u2019t you had any sleep Mr Frodo?","1959":"And I\u2019ve gone and had too much.  It must be getting late.","1960":"No, it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t midday yet.  The days are growing darker.","1961":"Come on! Must go! No time!","1962":"Not before Mr Frodo\u2019s had something to eat.","1963":"No time to lose silly!","1964":"Here.","1965":"What about you?","1966":"Oh no, I\u2019m not hungry, leastways not for lembas bread.","1967":"Sam!","1968":"Oh alright, but we don\u2019t have that much left. We have to be careful or we are going to run out. You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo. I\u2019ve rationed it, there should be enough.","1969":"For what?","1970":"The journey home.","1971":"Come Hobbitses, very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry.","1972":"It\u2019s good. Definitely from the Shire.  Longbottom leaf eh?","1973":"uhh huh  I feel like I\u2019m back at the Green Dragon.","1974":"Mmmm  Green Dragon!","1975":"A mug of ale in my hand. Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day\u2019s work.","1976":"Only,  you\u2019ve never done a hard day\u2019s work.","1977":"Ahaha! ","1978":"Welcome, my lords to Isengard!","1979":"You young rascals. A merry hunt you\u2019ve led us on and now we find you feasting and \u2026 and smoking!","1980":" We are sitting on a field of victory enjoying a few well earned comforts  The salted pork is particularly good.","1981":"Salted pork\u2026","1982":"Hobbits!","1983":"We\u2019re under orders from Treebeard who\u2019s taken over management of Isengard.","1984":"Hoooom, young master Gandalf, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come. Wood and water, stock and stone I can master, but there is a Wizard to manage here locked in his tower","1985":" Show yourself.","1986":"Be careful. Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.","1987":"Well then let\u2019s just have his head and be done with it.","1988":"No, we need him alive. We need him to talk.","1989":"You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend?Can we not have peace you and I?","1990":"We shall have peace\u2026. We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg\u2026 are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows\u2026 we shall have peace!","1991":"Gibbets and crows! Dotard! What do you want Gandalf Grahame? Let me guess\u2026 the key of Orthanc? Or perhaps the keys of Barad D\u00fbr itself? Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!","1992":"Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at risk. But you could save them Saruman. You were deep in the enemy\u2019s counsel.","1993":"So you have come here for information. I have some for you.  Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the great eye has seen it! Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon.  You are all going to die! But you know this don\u2019t you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King.  Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him\u2026 those he professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death.","1994":"I\u2019ve heard enough! Shoot him! Stick an arrow in his gob!","1995":"No! Come down Saruman and your life will be spared!","1996":"Save your pity and your mercy. I have no use for it! ","1997":"Saruman\u2026.. your staff is broken!","1998":"Grima! You need not follow him! You were not always as you are now. You were once a man of Rohan. Come down.","1999":"A man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master. You are a lesser son of greater sires!","2000":"Grima\u2026. Come down! Be free of him!","2001":"Free? He will never be free!","2002":"No!","2003":"Get down cur! ","2004":"Ah!","2005":"Saruman! You were deep in the enemy\u2019s counsel. Tell us what you know!","2006":"You withdraw your guard and I will tell you where your doom will be decided. I will not be held prisoner here!","2007":"Send word to all our allies and to every corner of Middle Earth that still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will strike.","2008":"The filth of Saruman is washing away. Trees will come back to live here.  Young trees. Wild trees.","2009":"Pippin! ","2010":"Bless my bark!","2011":"Peregrin Took. I\u2019ll take that my lad! Quickly now!","2012":"Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country.","2013":"Hail the victorious dead","2014":"Hail! ","2015":"No pauses,  no spills.","2016":"And no regurgitation! ","2017":"So\u2026 it\u2019s a drinking game?","2018":"Aye! ","2019":"Last one standing wins heh heh heh!","2020":"Lets drink to Victory! To Victory!","2021":"West\u00fb Aragorn, hal","2022":"I am very happy for you. He is an honourable man.","2023":"You are both honourable men.","2024":"It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.","2025":"Ach, don\u2019t listen to me. You are young and tonight is for you.","2026":"Heh heh heh heh  Here, here.  Raaar it\u2019s the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women haha ","2027":"I feel something.  A slight tingle in my fingers. I think it\u2019s affecting me. ","2028":"heh heh heh  what did I say? He can\u2019t hold his liquor.","2029":"Game over!","2030":"Pippin!","2031":" Thank you! I win!","2032":" No news of Frodo?","2033":"No word. Nothing.","2034":"We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.","2035":" Do we know that?","2036":" What does your heart tell you?","2037":" That Frodo is alive. Yes\u2026 yes he\u2019s alive.","2038":"Too risky. Too risky.  Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both! ","2039":"No!","2040":"Sshh, quiet, mustn\u2019t wake them. Mustn\u2019t ruin it now. ","2041":"But they knows,  they knows, they suspects us!","2042":"What\u2019s it saying my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve?","2043":"No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them\u2026. Dead!","2044":"And we will! Smeagol did it once, he can do it again!  Its ours! Ours!","2045":"We must get the precious! We must get it back!","2046":"Patience! Patience my love! First we must lead them to her!","2047":"We lead them to the winding stair.","2048":"Yes, the stairs and then?","2049":"Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel.","2050":"And when they go in, there\u2019s no coming out. She\u2019s always hungry. She always needs to\u2026 feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses.","2051":"And they doesn\u2019t taste very nice, does they Precious?","2052":"No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats.  Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes  then we will find it.","2053":"And take it for Meee!","2054":"For us.","2055":"Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead! ","2056":"You treacherous little toad!","2057":"No, no! Master!","2058":"No Sam! Leave him alone! ","2059":"I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.","2060":"Never! Smeagol wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly!  Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!","2061":"You miserable little maggot! I\u2019ll stove your head in!","2062":"Sam!","2063":"Call me a liar? You\u2019re a liar!","2064":"Waaaah!","2065":"If you scare him off then we are lost!","2066":"I don\u2019t care! I can\u2019t do it Mr Frodo! I won\u2019t wait around for him to kill us!","2067":"I\u2019m not sending him away.","2068":"You don\u2019t see it do you? He\u2019s a villain.","2069":"We can\u2019t do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.","2070":"I\u2019m on your side Mr Frodo","2071":"I know Sam, I know. Trust me. Come Smeagol.","2072":" What time is it?","2073":"Not yet dawn.","2074":"I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn  I could only stand there, waiting. ","2075":"Night changes many thoughts. Sleep Eowyn. Sleep while you can. ","2076":"The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East, a sleepless malice  The eye of the enemy is moving.","2077":"What are you doing?","2078":"Pippin!","2079":" Pippin!","2080":"Pippin! Are you mad?","2081":"I just want to look at it, just one more time.","2082":"Put it back!","2083":"Pippin!","2084":"No!","2085":" Pippin!","2086":"He is here!","2087":"I see you!","2088":"Pippin!","2089":"Help! Gandalf help!","2090":"Help him!","2091":"Pippin!","2092":"Fool of a Took!","2093":"No.","2094":"Look at me. ","2095":"Gandalf, forgive me! ","2096":"Look at me! What did you see?","2097":"A tree, there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone. It was dead.  The city was burning.","2098":"Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?","2099":"I saw\u2026 I saw him!  I could hear his voice in my head.","2100":"And what did you tell him? Speak!","2101":"He asked me my name. I didn\u2019t answer. He hurt me!","2102":"What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? ","2103":"There was no lie in Pippin\u2019s eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.","2104":"He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.  We\u2019ve been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse of the enemy\u2019s plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. ","2105":"His defeat at Helm\u2019s Deep showed our enemy one thing.  He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth  Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner.  He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground  before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit Rohan must be ready for war.","2106":"Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor?","2107":"I will go!","2108":"No!","2109":"They must be warned!","2110":"They will be.  You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the black ships.  Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith  and I wont be going alone.","2111":"Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry!","2112":"Where are we going?","2113":"Why did you look? Why do you always have to look?","2114":"I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t help it.","2115":"You never can!","2116":"I\u2019m sorry alright? I won\u2019t do it again.","2117":"Don\u2019t you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here.","2118":"And you? You\u2019re coming with me?  Merry? ","2119":"Come on!","2120":"How far is Minas Tirith?","2121":"Three days ride as the Nazg\u00fbl flies. And you\u2019d better hope we don\u2019t have one of those on our tail.","2122":"Here, something for the road. ","2123":"The last of the Longbottom Leaf?","2124":"I know you\u2019ve run out. You smoke too much Pippin.","2125":"But, we\u2019ll see each other soon?","2126":"Wont we?","2127":"I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know whats going to happen. ","2128":"Merry?","2129":"Run, Shadowfax show us the meaning of haste.","2130":"Merry!","2131":"Merry! ","2132":"He\u2019s always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get him out. Now he\u2019s gone.  Just like Frodo and Sam.","2133":"One thing I\u2019ve learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk.","2134":"Foolhardy maybe. He\u2019s a Took! ","2135":"Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the sea. The last journey of Arwen Und\u00f3miel.","2136":"There is nothing for you here only death.","2137":"Lady Arwen we cannot delay.  My lady!","2138":"Tell me what you have seen.","2139":"Arwen.","2140":"You have the gift of foresight. What did you see?","2141":"I looked into your future and I saw death.","2142":"But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son.","2143":"That future is almost gone.","2144":"But it is not lost.","2145":"Nothing is certain.","2146":"Some things are certain.","2147":"If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. It is time.","2148":"From the ashes of fire shall be woken, A light from the shadow shall spring, Renewed shall be blade that was broken,  The crownless again shall be king.","2149":"Reforge the sword\u2026 ada.","2150":"Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you.","2151":"This was my choice. Ada, whether by your will or not there is no ship now that can bear me hence.","2152":"We have just passed into the realm of Gondor.","2153":"Minas Tirith. City of Kings.","2154":"It\u2019s the tree! Gandalf, Gandalf.","2155":"Yes the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. Lord Denethor however, is not the King. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.","2156":"Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir\u2019s father. To give him news of his beloved son\u2019s death would be most unwise. And do not mention Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, its better if you don\u2019t speak at all Peregrin Took.","2157":"Hail Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor.","2158":"I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel.","2159":"Perhaps you come to explain this.","2160":"Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead.","2161":"Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from many foes. ","2162":"Pippin.","2163":"I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt.","2164":"This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not? So mighty as man as he was.","2165":"The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by many.","2166":"Get up!","2167":"My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor\u2019s armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.","2168":"You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship.","2169":"Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, steward.","2170":"The rule of Gondor is mine and no others!","2171":"Come!","2172":"All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak! A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again.","2173":"Why are they still guarding it?","2174":"They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was before it fell into decay.  The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their descent  dearer than the names of their sons.  Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.  The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.","2175":"Mordor.","2176":"Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.","2177":"A storm is coming.","2178":"This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron\u2019s making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin.","2179":"Well\u2026 Minas Tirith\u2026 very impressive.  So where are off to next?","2180":"Oh, it\u2019s too late for that Peregrin. There\u2019s no leaving this city.  Help must come to us.","2181":"It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.","2182":"We\u2019re not in decent places.","2183":"Mr Frodo? What is it?","2184":"It\u2019s just a feeling. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be coming back.","2185":"Yes you will. Of course you will. That\u2019s just morbid thinking. We\u2019re going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo. You\u2019ll see.","2186":"I think these lands were once part of the Kingdom of Gondor.","2187":"Long ago, when there was a King.","2188":"Mr Frodo, look! The King has got a crown again.","2189":"Come on, Hobbits! Mustn\u2019t stop now. This way!","2190":"So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.  I mean, they don\u2019t actually expect me to do any fighting, do they? ","2191":"You\u2019re in the service of the steward now. You\u2019ll have to do as you are told Peregrin Took. .","2192":"Ridiculous Hobbit! Guard of the Citadel!","2193":"Thank you. ","2194":"There\u2019s no more stars! Is it time? ","2195":"Yes.","2196":"It\u2019s so quiet.","2197":"It\u2019s the deep breath before the plunge.","2198":"I don\u2019t want to be in a battle. But waiting on the edge of one I can\u2019t escape is even worse.  Is there any hope Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?","2199":"There never was much hope. Just a fool\u2019s hope.  Our enemy is ready. His full strength\u2019s gathered. Not only orcs, but men as well  Legions of Haradrim from the South, mercenaries from the coast  All will answer Mordor\u2019s call. ","2200":"Come on!","2201":"This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.  If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone.","2202":"But we have the white wizard. That\u2019s got to count for something. .","2203":"Gandalf?","2204":"Sauron has yet to show his deadliest servant.  The one who will lead Mordor\u2019s army in war.  The one they say no living man can kill.  The Witch King of Angmar. You\u2019ve met him before.  He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.  He is the lord of the Nazg\u00fbl. The greatest of the nine.","2205":"The Dead City! Very nasty place full of enemies.","2206":"Quick, quick! They will see, they will see!","2207":"Come away, come away. Look we have found it. The way into Mordor.","2208":"The secret stair. Climb.","2209":"No! Mr Frodo","2210":"Not that way!","2211":"Whats it doing?","2212":"No!","2213":"They\u2019re calling me.","2214":"No!","2215":"Hide, hide!","2216":"I can feel his blade. ","2217":"We come to it at last.  The great battle of our time.","2218":"Come away Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.","2219":"The board is set, the pieces are moving.","2220":"Up, up, up the stairs we go. And then it\u2019s into the tunnel.","2221":"Hey, what\u2019s in this tunnel?  You listen to me! You listen good and proper. Anything happens to him, you\u2019ll have me to answer to. One sniff that something\u2019s not right, one hair that stands up on the back of my neck, its over. No more slinker, no more stinker.  You\u2019re gone. Got it? I\u2019m watching you. ","2222":"What was that about?","2223":"Nothing. Just clearing something up.","2224":"Peregrin Took my lad, there is a task now to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire folk to prove their great worth.  You must not fail me.","2225":"It\u2019s been very quiet across the river.","2226":"The Orcs are lying low. The garrison may have moved out. We\u2019ve sent scouts to Cair Andros. If the Orcs attack from the North, we\u2019ll have some warning.","2227":"Quiet.","2228":"We need 10 more.","2229":"Kill him.","2230":"They\u2019re not coming from the North! To the river quick, quick!","2231":"Go, come on!","2232":"Faster!  Draw swords. ","2233":"Hold! Hold them!","2234":"What?","2235":"Amon D\u00een.","2236":"The beacon! The beacon of Amon D\u00een is lit.","2237":"Hope is kindled!","2238":"The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!","2239":"Gondor calls for aid.","2240":"And Rohan will answer! Muster the Rohirrim.  Assemble the army at Dunharrow, as many men as can be found. You have two days.  On the third, we ride for Gondor\u2026 and war. ","2241":"Forward!","2242":"Very good sir.","2243":"Gamling.","2244":"My lord!","2245":"Make haste across the Riddermark. Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.","2246":"I will. ","2247":"Do you ride with us?","2248":"Just to the encampment. It\u2019s tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men.  The men have found their captain. They will follow you into battle. Even to death. You have given us hope. ","2249":"Excuse me!  I have a sword. Please accept it!  I offer you my service Theoden King.","2250":"And gladly, I accept it.  You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan. ","2251":"Horse men! I wish I could muster an army of Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.","2252":"Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. I fear war already marches on their own lands.","2253":" So, it is before the walls of Minas Tirith the doom of our time will be decided.","2254":" Now is the hour, Riders of Rohan. Oaths you have taken. Now fulfil them all, to Lord and Land! Hah!","2255":"We can\u2019t hold them. The city is lost.","2256":"Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.","2257":"Nazg\u00fbl!","2258":" Take cover! Nazgul! Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!","2259":"Fall back!  Retreat! Retreat! Run for your lives!","2260":"The age of men is over. The time of the Orc has come.","2261":"Keep going. It\u2019s the Nazgul. Take cover my lord.  It\u2019s coming.","2262":"Its Mithrandir! The White Rider!","2263":"Pull!","2264":"Mithrandir!  They broke through our defences. They\u2019ve taken the bridge and the West bank. Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.","2265":"It is as the Lord Denethor predicted! Long has he foreseen this doom!","2266":"Foreseen and done nothing!","2267":"Faramir? This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path.","2268":"No. ","2269":"You\u2019ve seen Frodo and Sam? ","2270":"Where? When?","2271":"In Ithilien. Not two days ago. Gandalf, they\u2019re taking the road to the Morgul vale.","2272":"And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.","2273":"What does that mean? What\u2019s wrong? He looks at Gandalf.","2274":"Faramir tell me everything. Tell me all you know.","2275":"This is how you would serve your city? You would risk its utter ruin?","2276":"I did what I judged to be right.","2277":"What you judged to be right! You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling! It should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe. Hidden. Dark and deep in the vaults\u2026 not to be used.  unless, at the uttermost end of need.","2278":"I would not use the Ring. Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her.","2279":"Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old. Boromir would have remembered his father\u2019s need. He would have brought me a kingly gift","2280":"Boromir would not have brought the Ring. He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen.","2281":"You know nothing of this matter!","2282":"He would have kept it for his own. And when he returned you would not have known your son.","2283":" Boromir was loyal to me! Not some wizard\u2019s pupil.","2284":"Father? ","2285":"My son!  Leave me! ","2286":"Careful master! Careful. Very far to fall. Very dangerous are the stairs.","2287":"Come master.","2288":"Come to Smeagol.","2289":"Mr Frodo!  Get back you! Don\u2019t touch him.","2290":"Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master?  Master carries a heavy burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden. Fat one cannot know.  He wants it. He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.  Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see. The fat one will take it from you! ","2291":"Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.","2292":"Slay them all!","2293":"What of the wizard?","2294":"I will break him.","2295":"Where are Theoden\u2019s riders?","2296":"Will Rohan\u2019s army come? Mithrandir?","2297":"Courage is the best defence that you have now.","2298":"What were you thinking Peregrin Took? What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of men?","2299":" It was well done. A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.  You are to join the tower guard.","2300":"I didn\u2019t think they would find any livery that would fit me.","2301":"It once belonged to a young boy of the city. A very foolish one who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies.","2302":"This was yours? ","2303":"Yes, it was mine. My father had it made for me. ","2304":"Well, I\u2019m taller than you were then. Though, I\u2019m not likely to grow anymore, except sideways. ","2305":"It never fitted me either. Boromir was always the soldier.  They were so alike he and my father. Proud, stubborn even, but strong.","2306":"I think you have strength of a different kind. And one day your father will see it. ","2307":"Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living or dying, from  \u2026 from this hour henceforth until my lord release me or death take me.","2308":"And I shall not forget it!  nor fail to reward that which is given.  Fealty with love.  Valour with honour. Disloyalty with vengeance.  I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences. Defences that your brother long held intact.","2309":"What would you have me do?","2310":"I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought. Osgiliath must be retaken.","2311":"My lord Osgiliath is over run.","2312":"Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his lord\u2019s will?","2313":"You wish now that our places had been exchanged. That I had died and Boromir had lived.","2314":"Yes, I wish that. ","2315":"Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead.  If I should return, think better of me father.","2316":"That will depend on the manner of your return. ","2317":"Ech!","2318":"What are you up to? Sneaking off are we?","2319":"Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say \u201csneak!\u201d Sneak? Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice , very nice!","2320":"Alright! Alright! You just startled me is all. What were you doing? ","2321":"Sneaking.","2322":"Fine, have it your own way.  I\u2019m sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be moving on. ","2323":"It\u2019s dark still.","2324":"It\u2019s always dark here.  It\u2019s gone!  The elven bread! ","2325":"What? That\u2019s all we have left!","2326":"He took it. He must have.","2327":"Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty elf bread. ","2328":"You\u2019re a lying rat! What did you do with it?","2329":" He doesn\u2019t eat it.  He can\u2019t have taken it.","2330":"Look, what\u2019s this?  Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!  He took it!  I\u2019ve seen him, he\u2019s always stuffing his face when master\u2019s not looking.","2331":"That\u2019s a filthy lie!  You stinking, two faced sneak! ","2332":"Sam!","2333":"Call me\u2026","2334":"Stop it! ","2335":"I\u2019ll kill him!","2336":"Sam, no! ","2337":"Oh my! I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it to go so far. I was just so, so angry! Here just\u2026 let\u2019s just rest a bit.","2338":"I\u2019m all right.","2339":"No. No you\u2019re not all right, you\u2019re exhausted. It\u2019s that Gollum. It\u2019s this place. It\u2019s that thing around your neck.  I could help a bit. I could carry it for a while , carry it for a while  I could carry it\u2026 I could carry it\u2026 Share the load\u2026 share the load\u2026 share the load ","2340":"Get away!","2341":"I don\u2019t want to keep it.  I just want to help.","2342":"See? See? He wants it for himself. ","2343":"Shut up you!  Go away! Get out of here!","2344":"No Sam! It\u2019s you!  I\u2019m sorry Sam. ","2345":" But he\u2019s a liar! He\u2019s poisoned you against me.","2346":"You can\u2019t help me any more.","2347":"You don\u2019t mean that.","2348":"Go home.","2349":" Faramir! Faramir!  Your father\u2019s will has turned to madness. Do not throw away your life so rashly.","2350":"Where does my allegiance lie if not here? This is the city of the men of N\u00famenor. I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty, her memory, her wisdom.","2351":"Your father loves you Faramir.  He will remember it before the end.","2352":"Can you sing Master Hobbit?","2353":" well, yes. At least well enough for my own people. But we have no songs for great halls and evil times.","2354":"And why should your songs be unfit for my halls? Come, sing me a song. ","2355":"Home is behind, The world ahead,  And there are many paths to tread, Through shadow, to the edge of night  Until the stars are all alight.  Mist and shadow cloud and shade, All shall fade, All shall  \u2026fade. ","2356":"March, march! March, march march!","2357":"Make way for the King! Make way, the King is here","2358":"My lord! ","2359":"Hail to you sire!","2360":"Grimbold, how many?","2361":"I bring 500 men from the Westfold my lord.","2362":"We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.","2363":"Where are the riders from Snowbourn?","2364":"None have come my lord.","2365":"Six thousand spears, less than half of what I had hoped for.","2366":"Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.","2367":" More will come ","2368":"Every hour lost hastens Gondor\u2019s defeat.  We have until dawn then we must ride.","2369":"The horses are restless and the men are quiet.","2370":"They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.","2371":"That road there where does that lead?","2372":"It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain.","2373":"None who venture there ever return. That mountain is evil.","2374":"Aragorn!  Let\u2019s find some food. ","2375":"There. A true esquire of Rohan.","2376":"I\u2019m ready!  Sorry. It isn\u2019t all that dangerous. It\u2019s not even sharp. ","2377":"Well that\u2019s no good. You wont kill many Orcs with a blunt blade. Come on.","2378":"To the smithy, go! ","2379":" You should not encourage him.","2380":"You should not doubt him.","2381":"I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm. ","2382":"Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. Why can he not fight for those he loves? ","2383":"You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him  and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold. Do you think he would stand and fight? He would flee. And he would be right to do so.  War is the province of men Eowyn. ","2384":"Sir? King Theoden awaits you my lord. ","2385":"I take my leave.","2386":" My lord Elrond","2387":"I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying. She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the evenstar is failing. As Sauron\u2019s power grows her strength wanes. Arwen\u2019s life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us Aragorn. The end has come.","2388":"It will not be our end, but his.","2389":" You ride to war but not to victory. Sauron\u2019s armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know. But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river.  A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South. They will be in the city in two days. You\u2019re outnumbered Aragorn. You need more men.","2390":"There are none.","2391":"There are those that dwell in the mountain.","2392":"Murderers, traitors. You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no one","2393":"They will answer to the King of Gondor.  And\u00faril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil.","2394":"Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil.","2395":"The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.","2396":"The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger. Become who you were born to be \u00d3nen i-Estel Edain. ","2397":"\u00da-chebin Estel anim. ","2398":"Why are you doing this? The war lies to the East. You cannot leave on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon the men.","2399":"Eowyn\u2026","2400":"We need you here.","2401":"Why have you come?","2402":"Do you not know?","2403":"It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek.","2404":"I have wished you joy since first I saw you.","2405":" Just where do you think you\u2019re off to?","2406":"Not this time. This time you must stay Gimli.","2407":"Hmmmm","2408":" Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves?","2409":"You might as well accept it. We\u2019re going with you laddie. Aragorn smiles.","2410":"What\u2019s happening, where is he going? I don\u2019t understand.  Lord Aragorn! Why does he leave on the eve of battle?","2411":"He leaves because there is no hope.","2412":"He leaves because he must.","2413":"To few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.","2414":"No, we cannot. But we will meet them in battle nonetheless. ","2415":"I have left instruction.  The people are to follow your rule in my stead.  Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the battle goes ill.","2416":"What other duty would you have me do my lord?","2417":"Duty?  no.  I would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come. You shall live to see these days renewed  \u2026 and no more despair","2418":"What kind of army would linger in such a place?","2419":"One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to the last King of Gondor  to come to his aid, to fight. But when the time came, when Gondor\u2019s need was dire, they fled vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight, the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the North shall he come, need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.","2420":"The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.","2421":"The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead  and the dead keep it.

The darkness is deepening.","2674":"If Sauron had the Ring we would know it.","2675":"It\u2019s only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping.","2676":"Let him stay there! Let him rot! Why should we care?","2677":"Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.","2678":"I\u2019ve sent him to his death.","2679":"No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that.","2680":"How?","2681":"Draw out Sauron\u2019s armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.","2682":"We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.","2683":"Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron\u2019s eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves.","2684":"A diversion.","2685":"Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for?","2686":"Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait.","2687":"Oh, I think he will.","2688":"Long have you hunted me. Long have I eluded you. No more!  Behold, the Sword of Elendil!","2689":"The City has fallen silent. There is no warmth left in the sun.","2690":"It grows so cold.","2691":"It\u2019s just the damp of the first spring rain.","2692":"I do not believe this darkness will endure.","2693":"Look! The Orcs, they\u2019re moving off!","2694":"You see Mr Frodo some luck at last!","2695":"Move it, you slugs!","2696":"Come on! Faster!","2697":"Come along you scum!  I\u2019ll whip you down to the bone! Come on! What have I told you.  Get up!  Come on you slugs! You two are going straight to the front line! Move it, come on! Fall in! Move it! Move it!

There\u2019s no point carrying anything we\u2019re not sure to need.","2714":"Mr Frodo, look.  There is light and beauty up there that no shadow can touch. ","2715":"Take mine.  There\u2019s a few drops left.","2716":"There will be none left for the return journey.","2717":"I don\u2019t think there will be a return journey Mr Frodo.","2718":"Frodo, get down!  Hide!","2719":"Frodo!","2720":"Where are they?","2721":"Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!  Let justice be done upon him! ","2722":"My master Sauron the Great bids thee welcome.","2723":"Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?","2724":"We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed. Tell your master this. The armies of Mordor must disband. He is to depart these lands, never to return.","2725":"Aha! Old Greybeard! I have a token I was bidden to show thee. ","2726":"Frodo!","2727":"Frodo!","2728":"Silence!","2729":"No!","2730":"Silence!","2731":"The Halfling was dear to thee I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who would\u2019ve thought one so small could endure so much pain? And he did Gandalf, he did.","2732":"And who is this? Isildur\u2019s heir? It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade.","2733":"I guess that concludes negotiations.","2734":"I do not believe it. I will not.","2735":"Pull back! Pull back!","2736":"It\u2019s gone Mr Frodo. The light\u2019s passed on, away towards the North. Something\u2019s drawn its gaze.","2737":"Hold your ground! Hold your ground!","2738":"Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers.  I see it in your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight!","2739":"By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand! Men of the West!","2740":"Never thought I\u2019d die fighting side by side with an elf.","2741":"What about side by side with a friend? ","2742":"Aye! I could do that.","2743":"Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets.  And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields,  and eating the first of the strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?","2744":"No Sam. I can\u2019t recall the taste of food, nor the sound of water or the touch of grass. I\u2019m naked in the dark. There\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s nothing, no veil between me and the wheel of fire.  I can see him with my waking eyes!","2745":"Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I can\u2019t carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on! ","2746":"Aragorn!  Elessar! ","2747":"For Frodo.","2748":"Look Mr Frodo, a doorway! We\u2019re almost there!","2749":"Clever Hobbits to climb so high!  Mustn\u2019t go that way. Mustn\u2019t hurt the precious!","2750":"You swore! You swore on the precious!","2751":"Smeagol promised!","2752":"Smeagol lied!
